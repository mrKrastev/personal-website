<h1>Karate ðŸ¥‹</h1>
<p>I trained karate for 12 years. This was the first sport/martial art that I trained. I was 5 when my father enrolled me and I am easily say that this was life changing experience. I used to have astma and thanks to the karate exercises I managed to overcome this condition. Moreover, karate helped me with building my character. It taught me patience, discipline and self-control. Karate was also the first activity that made me realize how important is to reflect on mistakes and always try to imrpove. I started competing when I was 7 and for 2 years I didn't have any success on any of the competitions. However, I kept attending the lessons and refused to leave defeated. And of course, hard work paid off and I managed to win my first competition... and not only. I kept the first place on every competition for 5 years in a row. I reached up to brown belt (1 level below black) and then I moved in UK. </p>

<h1>BoxingðŸ¥Š</h1>
<p>Since I moved to UK, I tried to continue doing karate. However, karate here was quite different as there were extra rules for health and safety. The competitions weren't as intense as people didn't really fight but it seemed like they were playing a tag game. I entered a competition once and i got to the finals, but during the final match I had a clean shot on the oponent which led to my disqualification. After this, I thought about it and I realised that karate is no longer fun to me, as training it didn't feel like a martial art anymore. We had less and less sparrings and I decided to find another sport that satisfies me. This is how I started boxing. I enjoy every session as I have a lot of energy and I always have the oppurtunity to release the stress. It also greatly improves cardio and physique which is a good bonus. Overall, I find it a great way to spend my time after a long day at University.</p>
