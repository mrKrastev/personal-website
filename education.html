        <time>Aston University Computer Science Course (2018-Present)</time> I am currently in the second year of my Computer Science course and I find this year definitely more exciting than my first year. We finally started to do more practical tasks involving system analysis and design. We have many more courseworks than the first year and we are being exposed to more real life scenarios and solutions. For example, teamworking on a project using Git.

        <time>Sutton Coldfield College (2016-2018)</time> When I had to choose my 3 A-levels I was already aware that I want to do Computer Science in the future. Therefore,
        one of the subjects I took was Computer Science. Since, I had to pick another 2, I thought that they must be complimentary to Computer Science and the obvious choice was Mathematics.
        The third subject was something that I couldnt decide on, and my Computer Science teacher in college advised me to take Physics. Both subjects are still useful to me and I do not regret taking them.
        In college I made a lot of progress in my programming skill as I was expected to make a database project. I hadnt been programing before that and it really showed me what it is like to create a software from scratch.
        I really enjoyed breaking down the problem and tackling each piece of the software components one by one until I had a complete project. I was introduced to visual studio and I felt like the IDE was very user friendly.
        I also took further mathematics in my first college year, where I did "Decision module" this topic still helps me as I learned in detail how sorting and packing alrigthms work. Physics was the subject that wasnt directly related to programming,
        however, skills that were required to solve a physics question, were also required in programming.

        <time>Erdington Academy (2015-2016)</time>When I first arrived in UK, I applied to all of the schools in the area so that I dont have a gap year. However, only 1 school accepted me and it was Erdington Academy.
        They asked me to have an entry exam to determine my level of education since they had no background data about me. After I completed the exams,  I was contacted by them in November and what they said was that There
        arent any spaces in year 10 and what they could offer me is that I enter in year 11 as my entry exams were very good and if I fail to do my GCSEs I can repeat year 11 again. I managed to complete the GCSEs in my first year in <thead>
          highschool and i managed to do most of the courseworks in less than 6 months. Therefore, I had the chance to go to college a year early than expected.

        <time>Bulgarian education (2007-2015)</time> My education in Bulgaria really helped me when I moved in UK. I started learning English at school at the age of 7. Bulgarian education tends to introduce more complicated
        topics to students at younger age and it was very useful for my entry exams when I arrived in England. I was ahead of everyone in all science and mathematics classes. Back in bulgaria I also was an excellent student and I was
        participating in regional competitions of which I won 2 in Mathematics and 1 in Bulgarian language.
