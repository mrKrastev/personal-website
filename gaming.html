      <h1>What games do I like?</h1>
      <p>I am a big fan of rpg games and, in fact, this is what most of my gaming experience consists of. Yes, just like the majority of children with access to a computer I have played
      Counter Strike and League of legends, however, the games that I enjoy the most are the ones that tell a story and immerse you into it. I particuarly dislike games such as FIFA
    as any sport game could be done in real life and I'd rather experience something that wouldnt happen in real life. The games that captured my attention for a while were the Witcher 3 and Dark  souls 3.
    The witcher 3 is an extremely beautiful game with great character development and a story that keeps you interested until the very end. The story telling is based on your choices in the game which gives you
  the feel that your choices DO make difference and you are actually writing a new story. The combat is something that really surprised me at first as I was impressed by the amount of thought I had to put before
  fighting a new enemy. The game doesnt allow you to just improvise on the spot and manage to beat every enemy just because you are the main character. A lot of the creature that you fight as a witcher have weaknesses
  and if you dont use them in your advantage, you make the game a lot more difficult. The music, the voice acting and the attention to detail really make this game a masterpiece in my opinion.
  Dark Souls 3 is also an impressive game, however, it isn't as popular as the witcher 3 since it isn't a game that holds the player's hand while playing. Instead the game doesnt tell you where to go or what to do.
  It is entirely up to you. The enemies in the game will punish you for every mistake you make and the game forces you to think while playing. This is what I really like about it. It is not a hack and slash game like
  most of the games nowadays. It makes you learn certain skills in order to proceed further and it makes sure that you feel the sense of achievement after you have beaten a boss. The PVP in this game is also one of the
  best since the combat system is the most accurate of any combat systems I have seen in any game. There are no items, gear and weapons that make others stronger than you and there is no way to pay for you to be stronger. The game is so balanced out that if you are good enough,
  you could beat anyone with any weapon and gear equiped. Therefore, pvp-ing other people really feels like a battle to death that depends on your decisions and reactions rather than gear level.
